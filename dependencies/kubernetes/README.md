# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available. You do not need to have detailed knowledge of either Kubernetes or Helm to use this project, but you may find it useful to review their basic documentation to become familiar with their key concepts and terminology.
